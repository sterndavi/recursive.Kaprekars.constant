### Trying to find the Kaprekar's constant in a recursive function

Last night (2022/04/30), I saw the following [Tiktok](https://www.tiktok.com/@mathletters/video/7091783499430153518?_t=8RuQirZ2XjR&_r=1), and the tought of how many iterations a giving number takes to get to **6174** stuck to my head, so I needed to try it for myself.

I've been studying functional programing lately, and for that reason I'm trying to use loops only as a last resort. That's my attempt to find the Kaprekar's constant recursively.

The code is a simple function that takes an integer as an input and prints to the console every interation, till it finishes in **6174**.

For sure it is not the optimal way to implement it and I wasn't able to find a way to count the iterations without making the function too impure.
